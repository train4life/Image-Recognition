# Under-21 Human Age Detection using Computer Vision

Conclusions:

After completing the "Under-21 Human Age Detection using Computer Vision" project, we can draw several significant conclusions:

Model Performance Achievement:

The primary objective of achieving a test Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of 7.1976 was successfully met.
Interestingly, adding more layers to the model resulted in a substantial increase in MAE. Therefore, the decision was made to keep the number of layers relatively low to maintain better performance.
Model Applicability:

The developed model demonstrates a high probability of effectively classifying individuals within the age groups of 14-48 years old.
This capability is valuable for the company, as it can aid in promptly identifying customers who fall within these age ranges.
For customers younger than 14 or older than 50, human employees should be able to recognize their age with a higher degree of accuracy.

Challenging Age Group Detection:

A particularly challenging age group to classify is individuals aged between 15-30 years old.
Within this range, determining whether a customer is over the age of 21 or not can be difficult.
The model developed in this project has shown promising results in accurately predicting this information.

Project Success:
Overall, the project has successfully achieved its goals by building a computer vision model that accurately detects and classifies individuals based on their age, specifically identifying those under the age of 21. The conclusions drawn from the model's performance provide actionable insights for the company's operations and customer interactions.

Usage and Future Improvements:
This project's findings can be used to enhance customer interactions and streamline age-related processes. Future improvements might involve:

- Collecting more diverse and extensive datasets to further improve the model's accuracy across different age ranges.
- Exploring additional data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
- Investigating other computer vision architectures to determine if there are more effective models for the specific task.
